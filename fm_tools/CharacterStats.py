# Razor Enhanced Scripts for Ultima Online by

# Use at your own risk. 

# This script is easy. Just bind it to a hotkey in razor and run it. No modifications needed.
# Will display a summary of character stats with some contextual help. Tested on UOEX, UOAlive, 
# and InsaneUO.
#
# The fact that this stuff isnt baked into clients (all the fun weapon hits and thresholds)
# is an absolute outrage and warrants federal investigation. Until then, behold.
