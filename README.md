### Ultima Online Razor Enhanced Script Library

These are scripts I've either written, liberally modified, or just store for safekeeping (these are the good ones written by others). I use these on a few free shards:
* UOEX
* UOAlive
* InsaneUO

They may or may not work on others.

You can safely clone this repo or just manually copy the files into your razord enhanced scripts directory. I have these organized as follows:

* core -> this is framework stuff I've written (for the most part). These don't do anythign on their own. You'll need a bootstrap scripts
* root directory -> This is the main stuff you see. Some of these use parts of the core lib, some are standalone. These are safe to run. You will map these to keybinds in razor for maximum effeciency.
